Basic concepts ....

1.Repository(place where you store all your project files)
2.Branch(is a collection of commits)
3.Commit(snapshot of the state of your file system)
4.Merge Conflict(when you change a line in a file & someone changes the same linr git doesnt know how to merge )
5.Pull Requests
6.Staging
7.Git ignore (doesnt keep a record of any files you dont want to track)



**** need to add gitignore file 
**** Processing sketch name must be the same as git name
